I divided all the examples by type:

  * [Glossary](glossary.md)
  * [Best practise and cases](best-practise-and-cases.md)
  * [Onbording](onbording.md)
  * [Interface overview](interface-overview.md)
  

And by domain:
 * IT & Technology

 * Logistics
 * Insurance
 * Retail & E-commerce
 * Oil & Energy
 * Media
